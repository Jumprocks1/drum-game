# Drum Game
A rhythm game for electronic drums that is meant to be used as a practice and performance tool.

It is built using [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework) with a lot of it's design inspired by [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu). There are also many features/hotkeys based on [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) and [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv).

## Status
This project is still in early development. Most of the features are geared towards making the game work specifically for me as the developer. It is intended to work for all configurations, but due to lack of testing, many configurations may not function right away.

## Running Drum Game
To start, download the latest [binary release](https://github.com/Jumprocks1/drum-game/releases).

## Contributing
Currently the source code for Drum Game is not yet released. In the future I plan to make the game open source (probably under GPLv3) so that others can more easily provide suggestions and contributions.
