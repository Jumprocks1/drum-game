# TODO
- Need wrapper for YouTube API so we can use it for non-websocket maps too
- Deploy https://gist.github.com/joshuapekera/ef364073b01fb0e21d3f
- Virtualize + animate song select
- Should probably make it so at the very least `index.html` doesn't trigger a 404 error (even though the 404 errors work fine)
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15970525/how-to-find-js-memory-leaks
- Canvas proxy for caching all canvas calls
    - Could also convert these calls into WebGL geometry
