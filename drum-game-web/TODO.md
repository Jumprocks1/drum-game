# TODO
- Need wrapper for YouTube API so we can use it for non-websocket maps too
- Deploy https://gist.github.com/joshuapekera/ef364073b01fb0e21d3f
- Virtualize + animate song select
- Add drag distance option so that dragging only triggers after a certain distance and the click event isn't completely blocked
