# TODO
- Need wrapper for YouTube API so we can use it for non-websocket maps too
- Should probably make it so at the very least `index.html` doesn't trigger a 404 error (even though the 404 errors work fine)
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15970525/how-to-find-js-memory-leaks
- Canvas proxy for caching all canvas calls
    - Could also convert these calls into WebGL geometry
    - Need FPS meter to measure this
- Add option to download .bjson from web view
- Have notices that the web client is WIP, and recommend the desktop client

# DTX stuff
- YouTube audio
- Pressing enter should load map on DTX view
- Automatically grab difficulty names from maps folder instead of using dtx.json
    - We do this when exporting to DTX anyways
