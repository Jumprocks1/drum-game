# database.db info

## Replays
Currently database.db stores summary statistics from replays.
If you delete database.db, you will lose all summary stastics of previous replays.
Any replays stored in /replays will need to be manually readded to the database. In the future this will hopefully be automatic.

## Beatmaps
In the future some local settings for beatmaps will be stored here as well.
